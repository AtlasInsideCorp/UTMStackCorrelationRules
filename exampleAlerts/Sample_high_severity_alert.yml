# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Alert Sample Severity High"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This is an example of a high-severity alert generated by UTMStack. 
                Its purpose is to illustrate how a real alert looks like and give you something to practice with during the tutorial."
  solution: "Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. 
            Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out.
            Use multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.
            Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies."
