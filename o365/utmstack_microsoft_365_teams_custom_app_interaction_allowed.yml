  severity: Medium
  description: 'Identifies when custom applications are allowed in Microsoft Teams. If an organization requires applications other than
    those available in the Teams app store, custom applications can be developed as packages and uploaded. An adversary may
    abuse this behavior to establish persistence in an environment.'
  solution: "<strong> False positive: </strong>Custom applications may be allowed by a system or network administrator. 
    Verify that the configuration change was expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
