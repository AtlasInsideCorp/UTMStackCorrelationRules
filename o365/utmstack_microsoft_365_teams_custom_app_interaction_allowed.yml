    <li>Use the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)</li>
    <li>Use of multi-factor authentication for public-facing webmail servers is a recommended best practice to minimize the usefulness of usernames and passwords to adversaries.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong>Custom applications may be allowed by a system or network administrator.
