- name: "Windows: Potential LSASS Clone Creation via PssCaptureSnapShot"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies the creation of an LSASS process clone via PssCaptureSnapShot where the parent process is the initial LSASS
                process instance. This may indicate an attempt to evade detection and dump LSASS memory for credential access."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.
      If the entire domain was compromised you must include a password reset.
      Locate and delete static files copied from Shadow Volume Copies.
      The mklink command line tool should require administrative access by default unless you are in developer mode.
      Run a full anti-malware scan. This can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
