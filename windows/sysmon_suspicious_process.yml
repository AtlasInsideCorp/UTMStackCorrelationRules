# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Windows: Sysmon - Suspicious Process"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. 
                Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. 
                Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process is memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. 
                Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process."
  solution: "Some endpoint security solutions can be configured to block some types of process injection based on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process."
