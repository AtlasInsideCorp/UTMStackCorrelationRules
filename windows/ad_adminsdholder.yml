- name: "Windows: AdminSDHolder Backdoor"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Detects modifications in the AdminSDHolder object. Attackers can abuse the SDProp process to implement a persistent
                backdoor in Active Directory. SDProp compares the permissions on protected objects with those defined on the
                AdminSDHolder object. If the permissions on any of the protected accounts and groups do not match, the permissions on
                the protected accounts and groups are reset to match those of the domain is AdminSDHolder object, regaining their
                Administrative Privileges."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
