- name: "Exporting Exchange Mailbox via PowerShell"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the use of the Exchange PowerShell cmdlet, New-MailBoxExportRequest, to export the contents of a primary
                mailbox or archive to a .pst file. Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information."
  solution: "Verify if the involved host is the Exchange server, if it is isolate the host to prevent further post-compromise behavior. Use the Remove-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to remove fully or partially completed export requests.
        Prioritize cases that involve personally identifiable information (PII) or other classified data. Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
        identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
        Review the privileges of users with the Mailbox Import Export privilege to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
        Run a full scan using the antimalware tool in place. This scan can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
        Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
