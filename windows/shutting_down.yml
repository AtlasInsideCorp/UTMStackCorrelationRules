  description: "Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. 
                Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. 
                In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer 
                or network device via Network Device CLI Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users.
                Adversaries may attempt to shutdown/reboot a system after impacting it in other ways, such as Disk Structure Wipe or Inhibit System Recovery, 
                to hasten the intended effects on system availability"
