- name: "Windows: Renamed AutoIt Scripts Interpreter"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies a suspicious AutoIt process execution. Malware written as an AutoIt script tends to rename the AutoIt
                executable to avoid detection."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
