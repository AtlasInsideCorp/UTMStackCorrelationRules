# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Command Shell Activity Started via RunDLL32"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies command shell activity started via RunDLL32, which is commonly abused by attackers to host malicious code."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware. Stop suspicious processes.
      Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.
      Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
