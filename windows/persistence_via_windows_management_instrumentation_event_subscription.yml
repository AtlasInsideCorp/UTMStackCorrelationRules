# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Persistence via WMI Event Subscription"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "An adversary can use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to install event filters, providers, consumers, and
                bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an
                event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:
      Block the email sender from sending future emails. Block the malicious web pages.
      Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components."
