- name: "Disable Windows Event and Security Logs Using Built-in Tools as Logman"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies attempts to disable EventLog via the logman Windows utility. This is often done by
                attackers in an attempt to evade detection on a system."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Re-enable affected logging components, services, and security monitoring.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
