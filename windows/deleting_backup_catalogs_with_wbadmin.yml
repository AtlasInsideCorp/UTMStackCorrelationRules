- name: "Deleting Backup Catalogs with Wbadmin"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies use of the wbadmin.exe to delete the backup catalog. Ransomware and other malware may do this to prevent
                system recovery."
  solution: "Consider isolating the involved host to prevent destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      If any other destructive action was identified on the host, it is recommended to prioritize the investigation and look
      for ransomware preparation and execution activities. If any backups were affected:
      Perform data recovery locally or restore the backups from replicated copies (cloud, other servers, etc.).
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
