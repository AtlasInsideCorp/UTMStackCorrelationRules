- name: "Probable replay attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This event generates on domain controllers when KRB_AP_ERR_REPEAT Kerberos response was sent to the client. 
                Domain controllers cache information from recently received tickets. If the server name, client name, time, 
                and microsecond fields from the Authenticator match recently seen entries in the cache, it will return KRB_AP_ERR_REPEAT. 
                You can read more about this in RFC-1510. One potential cause for this is a misconfigured network device between the 
                client and server that could send the same packet(s) repeatedly."
  solution: "This event can be a sign of Kerberos replay attack or, among other things, network device configuration or routing problems. In both cases, we recommend you to investigate the reason the event was generated."
