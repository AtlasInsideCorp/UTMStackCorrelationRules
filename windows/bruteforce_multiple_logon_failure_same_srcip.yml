# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Multiple Logon Failure from the same Source Address"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies multiple consecutive logon failures from the same source address and within a short time interval.
                Adversaries will often brute force login attempts across multiple users with a common or known password, in an attempt
                to gain access to accounts."
  solution: "If the host is a domain controller (DC):
      Review the privileges assigned to users that can access the DCs, to ensure that the least privilege principle is
      being followed and to reduce the attack surface. Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
