- name: "Wireless Credential Dumping using Netsh Command"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies attempts to dump Wireless saved access keys in clear text using the Windows built-in utility Netsh."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.
      If the entire domain was compromised you must include a password reset.
      Locate and delete static files copied from Shadow Volume Copies.
      The mklink command line tool should require administrative access by default unless you are in developer mode.
      Run a full anti-malware scan. This can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
