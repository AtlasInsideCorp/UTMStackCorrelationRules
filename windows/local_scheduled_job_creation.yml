# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Persistence via Scheduled Job Creation"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "A job can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. Adversaries may abuse
                task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:
      Block the email sender from sending future emails. Block the malicious web pages.
      Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components."
