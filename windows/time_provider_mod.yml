# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Potential Persistence via Time Provider Modification"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies modification of the Time Provider. Adversaries may establish persistence by registering and enabling a
                malicious DLL as a time provider. Windows uses the time provider architecture to obtain accurate time stamps from other
                network devices or clients in the network. Time providers are implemented in the form of a DLL file which resides in the
                System32 folder. The service W32Time initiates during the startup of Windows and loads w32time.dll."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:
      Block the email sender from sending future emails. Block the malicious web pages.
      Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components."
