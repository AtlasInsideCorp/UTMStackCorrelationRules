# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "PowerShell Kerberos Ticket Request"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects PowerShell scripts that have the capability of requesting kerberos tickets, which is a common step in
                Kerberoasting toolkits to crack service accounts."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials. Prioritize privileged accounts.
      Isolate involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
