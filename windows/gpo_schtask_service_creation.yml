- name: "Creation or Modification of a new GPO Scheduled Task or Service"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Detects the creation or modification of a new Group Policy based scheduled task or service. These methods are used for
                legitimate system administration, but can also be abused by an attacker with domain admin permissions to execute a
                malicious payload remotely on all or a subset of the domain joined machines."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:
      Block the email sender from sending future emails. Block the malicious web pages.
      Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components."
