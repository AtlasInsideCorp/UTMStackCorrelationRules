# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Process Termination followed by Deletion"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies a process termination event quickly followed by the deletion of its executable file. Malware tools and other
                non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what occurred. Removal
                of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's
                footprint."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
        Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.
        Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
        identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
        Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
        Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
