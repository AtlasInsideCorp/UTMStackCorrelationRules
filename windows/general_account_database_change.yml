- name: "General account database change"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. 
                Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, 
                such as modifying credentials or permission groups. "
  solution: "Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts
        Configure access controls and firewalls to limit access to critical systems and domain controllers.
        Protect domain controllers by ensuring proper security configuration for critical servers 
        to limit access by potentially unnecessary protocols and services, such as SMB file sharing."
