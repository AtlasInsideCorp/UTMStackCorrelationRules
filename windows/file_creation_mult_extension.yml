  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Masquerading can allow an adversary to evade defenses and better blend in with the environment. One way it occurs is
                when the name or location of a file is manipulated as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a
                benign file type but is actually executable code."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, systems and web services.
      If triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts. Implement temporary rules, procedures and network segmentation to contain malware.
      Stop suspicious processes. Immediately block identified Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect affected systems for additional malware backdoors, such as reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to re-infect the system. Eliminate and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full scan with the anti-malware tool installed. This scan may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
