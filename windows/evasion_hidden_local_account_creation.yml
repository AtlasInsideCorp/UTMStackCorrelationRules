# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Creation of a Hidden Local User Account"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies the creation of a hidden local user account by appending the dollar sign to the account name. This is
                sometimes done by attackers to increase access to a system and avoid appearing in the results of accounts listing using
                the net users command."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior. Delete the hidden account.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
