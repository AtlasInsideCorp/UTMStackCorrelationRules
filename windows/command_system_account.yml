- name: "Windows: Account Discovery Command via SYSTEM Account"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies when the SYSTEM account uses an account discovery utility. This could be a sign of discovery activity after
                an adversary has achieved privilege escalation."
  solution: " Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.
      Use the data collected through the analysis to investigate other machines affected in the environment."
