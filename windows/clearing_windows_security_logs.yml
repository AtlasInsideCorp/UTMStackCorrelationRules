# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows Event Logs Cleared"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies attempts to clear Windows event log stores. This is often done by attackers in an attempt to evade detection
                or destroy forensic evidence on a system."
  solution: "This activity is potentially done after the adversary achieves its objectives on the host. Ensure that previous
      actions, if any, are investigated accordingly with their response playbooks.
      Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
