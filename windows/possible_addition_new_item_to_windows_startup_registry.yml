# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Windows: Possible addition of new item to Windows startup registry"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. 
                Adding an entry to the run keys in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. 
                These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level."
  solution: "This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features."
  category: "Potentially Compromised System"
  tactic: "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder"
