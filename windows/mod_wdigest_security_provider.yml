- name: "Windows: Modification of WDigest Security Provider"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies attempts to modify the WDigest security provider in the registry to force the users password to be stored in
                clear text in memory. This behavior can be indicative of an adversary attempting to weaken the security configuration of
                an endpoint. Once the UseLogonCredential value is modified, the adversary may attempt to dump clear text passwords from
                memory."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
