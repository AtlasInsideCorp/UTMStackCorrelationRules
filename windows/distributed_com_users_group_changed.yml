# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Windows: Distributed COM users group changed"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in domain environments. 
                Domains provide a centralized means of managing how computer resources (ex: computers, user accounts) can act, and interact with each other, on a network. 
                The policy of the domain also includes configuration settings that may apply between domains in a multi-domain/forest environment. 
                Modifications to domain settings may include altering domain Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or changing trust settings for domains, including federation trusts."
  solution: "Identify and correct GPO permissions abuse opportunities (ex: GPO modification privileges) using auditing tools.
        Consider implementing WMI and security filtering to further tailor which users and computers a GPO will apply to"
