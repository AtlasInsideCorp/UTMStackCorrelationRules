# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Delete Volume USN Journal with Fsutil"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies use of the fsutil.exe to delete the volume USNJRNL. This technique is used by attackers to eliminate evidence
                of files created during post-exploitation activities."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.
      Stop suspicious processes.Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.
      Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Exclusion lists for antimalware capabilities should always be routinely monitored for review.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
