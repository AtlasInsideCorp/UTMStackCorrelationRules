- name: "Full User-Mode Dumps Enabled System-Wide"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the enable of the full user-mode dumps feature system-wide. This feature allows Windows Error Reporting (WER)
                to collect data after an application crashes. This setting is a requirement for the LSASS Shtinkering attack, which
                fakes the communication of a crash on LSASS, generating a dump of the process memory, which gives the attacker access to
                the credentials present on the system without having to bring malware to the system. This setting is not enabled by
                default, and applications must create their registry subkeys to hold settings that enable them to collect dumps."
  solution: "If specific credentials were compromised reset the password for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials
      If the entire domain was compromised, perform a password reset.
      Investigate how the attacker escalated privileges and identify the systems used to make the lateral move. use this
      information to determine ways the attacker could use to regain access to the environment.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
