# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Windows: Account Configured with Never-Expiring Password"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects the creation and modification of an account with the Dont Expire Password option Enabled. Attackers can abuse
                this misconfiguration to persist in the domain and maintain long-term access using compromised accounts with this
                property."
  solution: "Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Reset the password of the account and update its password settings.
      Search for other occurrences on the domain.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts, if
      any, are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email,
      business systems, and web services."
