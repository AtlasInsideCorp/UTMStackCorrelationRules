# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "DNS-over-HTTPS Enabled via Registry"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies when a user enables DNS-over-HTTPS. This can be used to hide internet activity or the process of exfiltrating
                data. With this enabled, an organization will lose visibility into data such as query type, response, and originating
                IP, which are used to determine bad actors."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Re-enable affected logging components, services, and security monitoring.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
