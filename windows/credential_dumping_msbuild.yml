# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Potential Credential Access via Trusted Developer Utility"
  severity: "High"
  description: "An instance of MSBuild, the Microsoft Build Engine, loaded DLLs (dynamically linked libraries) responsible for Windows
                credential management. This technique is sometimes used for credential dumping."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts. Stop suspicious processes.
      Immediately block identified Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect affected systems for additional malware backdoors, such as reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to re-infect the system.
      Eliminate and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.
      Run a full anti-malware scan. This can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
