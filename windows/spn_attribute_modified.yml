- name: "Windows: User account exposed to Kerberoasting"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Detects when a user account has the servicePrincipalName attribute modified. Attackers can abuse write privileges over a
                user to configure Service Principle Names (SPNs) so that they can perform Kerberoasting. Administrators can also
                configure this for legitimate purposes, exposing the account to Kerberoasting."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business
      systems, and web services. Prioritize privileged accounts.
      Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
