# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Creation or Modification of Domain Backup DPAPI private key"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies the creation or modification of Domain Backup private keys. Adversaries may extract the Data Protection API
                (DPAPI) domain backup key from a Domain Controller (DC) to be able to decrypt any domain user master key file."
  solution: "Reset the target accounts password if there is any risk of TGTs having been retrieved.
      Re-enable the preauthentication option or disable the target account.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services."
