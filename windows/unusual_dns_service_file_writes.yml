# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Unusual File Modification by dns.exe"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies an unexpected file being modified by dns.exe, the process responsible for Windows DNS Server services, which
                may indicate activity related to remote code execution or other forms of exploitation."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Reimage the host operating system or restore the compromised server to a clean state. Install the latest patches on systems that run Microsoft DNS Server.
      Consider the implementation of a patch management system, such as the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).
      Run a full scan using the antimalware tool in place. This scan can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed."
