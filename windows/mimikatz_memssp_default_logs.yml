# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Mimikatz Memssp Log File Detected"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies the password log file from the default Mimikatz memssp module."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the host is a Domain Controller (DC), review the privileges assigned to users that can access the DCs to ensure that the least privilege principle is
      being followed and reduce the attack surface.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Reboot the host to remove the injected SSP from memory.
      Reimage the host operating system or restore compromised files to clean versions.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
