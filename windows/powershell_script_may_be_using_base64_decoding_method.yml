- name: "Windows: Powershell script may be using Base64 decoding method or executing suspicious code with CreateThread API"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. 
                They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. 
                Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system."
  solution: "This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features."
