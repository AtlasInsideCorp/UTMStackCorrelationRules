- name: "Windows: Third-party Backup Files Deleted via Unexpected Process"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the deletion of backup files, saved using third-party software, by a process outside of the backup suite.
                Adversaries may delete Backup files to ensure that recovery from a ransomware attack is less likely."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Consider isolating the involved host to prevent destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.
      Perform data recovery locally or restore the backups from replicated copies (Cloud, other servers, etc.).
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
