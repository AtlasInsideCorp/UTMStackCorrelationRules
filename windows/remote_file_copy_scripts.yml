# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Remote File Download via Script Interpreter"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies built-in Windows script interpreters (cscript.exe or wscript.exe) being used to download an executable file
                from a remote destination."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.
      Stop suspicious processes.
      Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to reinfect the system.
      Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and
      malware components.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business
      systems, and web services.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
