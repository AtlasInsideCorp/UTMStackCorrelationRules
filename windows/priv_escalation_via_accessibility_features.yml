# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Potential Modification of Accessibility Binaries"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in. An
                adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.
      Stop suspicious processes. Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to reinfect the system. Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
