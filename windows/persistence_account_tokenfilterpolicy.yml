# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Windows: Local Account TokenFilter Policy Disabled"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies registry modification to the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy policy. If this value exists (which doesn't by
                default) and is set to 1, then remote connections from all local members of Administrators are granted full
                high-integrity tokens during negotiation."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
