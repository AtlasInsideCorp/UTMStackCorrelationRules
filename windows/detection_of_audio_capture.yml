- name: "Windows: PowerShell Suspicious Script with Audio Capture Capabilities"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects PowerShell scripts that can record audio, a common feature in popular post-exploitation tooling."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      The response must be prioritized if this alert involves key executives or potentially valuable targets for espionage.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
