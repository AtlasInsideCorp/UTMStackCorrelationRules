- name: "Windows Registry File Creation in SMB Share"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the creation or modification of a medium-size registry hive file on a Server Message Block (SMB) share, which
                may indicate an exfiltration attempt of a previously dumped Security Account Manager (SAM) registry hive for credential
                extraction on an attacker-controlled system."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
