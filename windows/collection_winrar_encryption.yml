- name: "Encrypting Files with WinRar or 7z"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies use of WinRar or 7z to create an encrypted files. Adversaries will often compress and encrypt data in
                preparation for exfiltration."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business
      systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and
      malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the
      me an time to respond (MTTR)"
