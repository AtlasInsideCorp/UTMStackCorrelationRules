# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Potential Remote Desktop Tunneling Detected"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies potential use of an SSH utility to establish RDP over a reverse SSH Tunnel. This can be used by attackers to
                enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Take the necessary actions to disable the tunneling, which can be a process kill, service deletion, registry key
      modification, etc. Inspect the host to learn which method was used and to determine a response for the case.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
