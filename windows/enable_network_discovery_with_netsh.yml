# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Enable Host Network Discovery via Netsh"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies use of the netsh.exe program to enable host discovery via the network. Attackers can use this command-line
                tool to weaken the host firewall settings."
  solution: "Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.
        Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
        Disable Network Discovery:
        Using netsh: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=Network Discovery new enable=No
        Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
        identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
        Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
        Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
