- name: "Enumerating Domain Trusts via NLTEST.EXE"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies the use of nltest.exe for domain trust discovery purposes. Adversaries may use this command-line utility to
      enumerate domain trusts and gain insight into trust relationships, as well as the state of Domain Controller (DC)
      replication in a Microsoft Windows NT Domain."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.
      Use the data collected through the analysis to investigate other machines affected in the environment."
