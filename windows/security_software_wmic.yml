# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Security Software Discovery using WMIC"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the use of Windows Management Instrumentation Command (WMIC) to discover certain System Security Settings
                such as AntiVirus or Host Firewall details."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector."
