- name: "GCP Logging Sink Modification"
  severity: Low
  description: "Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once theyâ€™ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission. <br>
    Identifies a modification to a Logging sink in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Logging compares the log entry to the sinks
    in that resource. Each sink whose filter matches the log entry writes a copy of the log entry to the sink's export
    destination. An adversary may update a Logging sink to exfiltrate logs to a different export destination."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Implement network-based filtering restrictions to prohibit data transfers to untrusted VPCs.</li>
    <li>Consider rotating access keys within a certain number of days to reduce the effectiveness of stolen credentials.</li>
    <li>Limit user account and IAM policies to the least privileges required. Consider using temporary credentials for accounts that are only valid for a certain period of time to reduce the effectiveness of compromised accounts.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Logging sink modifications may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource
    name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Sink modifications from unfamiliar users or
    hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
