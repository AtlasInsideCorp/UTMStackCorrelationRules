- name: "GCP IAM Custom Role Creation"
  severity: Medium
  description: "Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.<br>
    Identifies an Identity and Access Management (IAM) custom role creation in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Custom roles are
    user-defined, and allow for the bundling of one or more supported permissions to meet specific needs. Custom roles will
    not be updated automatically and could lead to privilege creep if not carefully scrutinized."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Ensure that applications do not store sensitive data or credentials insecurely. (e.g. plaintext credentials in code, published credentials in repositories, or credentials in public cloud storage).</li>
    <li>Applications and appliances that utilize default username and password should be changed immediately after the installation, and before deployment to a production environment. When possible, applications that use SSH keys should be updated periodically and properly secured.</li>
    <li>Audit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. These audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Custom role creations may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource
    name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Role creations from unfamiliar users or hosts
    should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
