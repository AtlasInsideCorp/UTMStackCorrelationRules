    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Storage buckets may be deleted by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource name,
    and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Bucket deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should
    be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
