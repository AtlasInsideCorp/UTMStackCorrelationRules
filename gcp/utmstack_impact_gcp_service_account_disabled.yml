  description: "Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes.

These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach. <br>
    Identifies when a service account is disabled in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A service account is a special type of
    account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts to
    make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself, or as G Suite or Cloud Identity users
    through domain-wide delegation. An adversary may disable a service account in order to disrupt to disrupt their target's
    business operations."
