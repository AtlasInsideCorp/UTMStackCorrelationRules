- name: "GCP Storage Bucket Configuration Modification"
  severity: Medium
  description: "Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tacticsâ€™ techniques are cross-listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses. <br>
    Identifies when the configuration is modified for a storage bucket in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). An adversary may
    modify the configuration of a storage bucket in order to weaken the security controls of their target's environment."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Storage bucket configuration may be modified by system administrators. Verify that the configuration change was
    expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
