- name: "System Linux: File Permission Modification in Writable Directory"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies file permission modifications in common writable directories by a non-root user. Adversaries often drop files
                or payloads into a writable directory and change permissions prior to execution."
  solution: "Ensure critical system files as well as those known to be abused by adversaries have restrictive permissions and are owned by
      an appropriately privileged account, especially if access is not required by users nor will inhibit system functionality.
      Applying more restrictive permissions to files and directories could prevent adversaries from modifying their access control lists. 
      Additionally, ensure that user settings regarding local and remote symbolic links are properly set or disabled where unneeded"
