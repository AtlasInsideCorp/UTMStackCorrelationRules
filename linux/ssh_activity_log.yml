- name: "System Linux: Probable OpenSSH Activity"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies a Secure Shell (SSH) client or server process creating or writing to a known SSH backdoor log file.
                Adversaries may modify SSH related binaries for persistence or credential access via patching sensitive functions to
                enable unauthorized access or to log SSH credentials for exfiltration."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified.
      Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
