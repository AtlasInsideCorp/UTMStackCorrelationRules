- name: "System Linux: Potential Shadow File Read via Command Line Utilities"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies access to the /etc/shadow file via the commandline using standard system utilities. After elevating
                privileges to root, threat actors may attempt to read or dump this file in order to gain valid credentials. They may
                utilize these to move laterally undetected and access additional resources."
  solution: "Make it difficult for adversaries to advance their operation through exploitation of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities by using sandboxing. 
      Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. 
      Risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in these systems may still exist. 
      Consider blocking the execution of known vulnerable drivers that adversaries may exploit to execute code in kernel mode. 	
      Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. 
      Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for software components targeted for privilege escalation."
