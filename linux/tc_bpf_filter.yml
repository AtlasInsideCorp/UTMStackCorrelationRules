- name: "System Linux: BPF filter applied using TC"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Detects when the tc (transmission control) binary is utilized to set a BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) on a network interface. 
                Tc is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel. It can shape, schedule, police and drop traffic. 
                A threat actor can utilize tc to set a bpf filter on an interface for the purpose of manipulating the incoming traffic. 
                This technique is not at all common and should indicate abnormal, suspicious or malicious activity."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
