- name: "System Linux: Potential Privilege Escalation via PKEXEC"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies an attempt to exploit a local privilege escalation in polkit pkexec (CVE-2021-4034) via unsecure environment
                variable injection. Successful exploitation allows an unprivileged user to escalate to the root user."
  solution: "Make it difficult for adversaries to advance their operation through exploitation of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities by using sandboxing. 
      Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. 
      Risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in these systems may still exist. 
      Consider blocking the execution of known vulnerable drivers that adversaries may exploit to execute code in kernel mode. 	
      Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. 
      Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for software components targeted for privilege escalation."
