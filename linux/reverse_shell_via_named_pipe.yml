- name: "System Linux: Reverse Shell Created via Named Pipe"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies a reverse shell via the abuse of named pipes on Linux with the help of OpenSSL or Netcat. First in, first out
                (FIFO) files are special files for reading and writing to by Linux processes. For this to work, a named pipe is created
                and passed to a Linux shell where the use of a network connection tool such as Netcat or OpenSSL has been established.
                The stdout and stderr are captured in the named pipe from the network connection and passed back to the shell for
                execution."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
