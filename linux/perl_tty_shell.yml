- name: "System Linux: Interactive Terminal Spawned via Perl"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies when a terminal (tty) is spawned via Perl. Attackers may upgrade a simple reverse shell to a fully
                interactive tty after obtaining initial access to a host."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
