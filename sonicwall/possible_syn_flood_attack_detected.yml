- name: "Possible SYN flood attack detected by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "It tries to make a server unavailable for legitimate traffic by consuming all its available resources. 
                By repeatedly sending initial connection request (SYN) packets, the attacker can overload all available ports on the attacked server, 
                causing the device to respond to legitimate traffic very slowly or even not at all."
  solution: "When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the targeted network connection, it is typically necessary to intercept incoming upstream traffic to filter attack traffic from legitimate traffic.
      Depending on the volume of the flood, local filtering may be possible by blocking the source addresses that originate the attack, 
      blocking the ports that are targeted, or blocking the protocols that are used for transport."
