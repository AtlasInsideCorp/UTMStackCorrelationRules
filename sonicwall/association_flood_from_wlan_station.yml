- name: "Association Flood from WLAN station"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A flood attack refers to the case where WLAN devices receive large volumes of frames of the same kind within a short span of time. 
                When this occurs, the WLAN devices are overwhelmed. Consequently, they are unable to service normal clients"
  solution: "When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the targeted network connection, it is typically necessary to intercept incoming upstream traffic to filter attack traffic from legitimate traffic.
      Depending on the volume of the flood, local filtering may be possible by blocking the source addresses that originate the attack, 
      blocking the ports that are targeted, or blocking the protocols that are used for transport."
