- name: "Probable CISCO ASA Defense Evasion vulnerability by modifying shun list"
  severity: Low
  description: "The adversary is trying to avoid being detected. Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. 
                Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tacticsâ€™ techniques are cross-listed 
                here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.
                In this case someone deleted a hostname from shun list, may be normal action or a defense evasion attack.
                Please see the logs attached to this alert for additional details."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Check why a hostname was eliminated from shun list and who was responsible for that.</li>
    <li>Check the configurations of the <strong>threat-detection scanning-threat shun<strong> command</li>
    </ol>"
